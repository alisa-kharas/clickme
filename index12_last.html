                    I chose regular Helvetica font to make the brochure look very simple

                    The paper and the font were selected that simple to show that this booklet is useless same as book appendices without the context are useless

                    But at the same time, they value same as the appendix as the body part

                    And as another meaning of appendix is an additional part of the book my primary research was the books about the appendix, appendectomy, appendicitis and its treatment

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I decided to choose a very basic action such as putting on shoes

                    I found the problems a person might face while making this action

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    The issues were identifying the correct shoe for each leg

                    And the direction of putting your foot inside

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Shoe identity was solved by making the outline for each shoe

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So that a user will be able to compare the boot curves with the drawn curves

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    The proper direction of sticking your foot inside was solved by making the arrow that shows the way

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I tried to simplify the steps in the manual in order to make it easier to follow them and so they would fit on a small door mat and still would be readable

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Also

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    My main focus in this project was the surface the action takes place

                <div class="speech-bubble18">
                    The door mat is the most common place you put on shoes so I find it the most convenient surface to put on instruction

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I started my research with primary by putting my shoes on myself and watching youtube video instructions

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    That helped me to realise the actions I make, in which order and how I actually make them

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    And I realised that the instruction needs to be universal so there is no difference which type of shoes you put on
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I read the article about teaching a kid how to put on shoes helped me most as I finally realised that action we all do automatically actually might have some issues such as which shoe is right and which is left for example
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I researched different instructions as well, but from my personal experience the combination of image and text the most successful

                    The key design idea was the name of her gallery ‘Empty space’ as the gallery was the key point I wanted to talk with her about

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I researched on the designs conceptuallybased on Empty space

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Looked through the interviews with the curators and gallerists

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Metamodernism was what she mostly talked about,

                    This term was new for me

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So I looked through the essay by Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker “Notes on Metamodernism”

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    This movement believes actually reminded me of palimpsest a lot

                    As the interview consists of several thoughts, I decided to separate them by pages

                    Highlighting the theme which is discussed at the bottom of the page

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    Another solution for showing overlaying of metamodern I found was to place the images which illustrate the subjects Eva talks about underneath the text

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So that it could be printed duo color on a risograph and then could be readable

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    And visually I was trying to keep the gallery curator method by thinking how the photographs with text fit together

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    We researched the differences the dogs have such as breeds, age, sizes, colours, fur patterns, name, behaviour

                    Thus we moved on to thinking of the way we can collect this information from the owners

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    And came up with the online survey

                    We read through our statement once again and realised that our clients are wealthy people

                    So we researched lux brands websites, read some articles on how the VIP segment sites are made in case of designed

                    The critical points for a lux brand website are simplicity, white background, black thin sans serif fonts

                    Based on that knowledge we made our logo, imagery, chose colours and fonts

                    We made a group photoshoot with two of us and four dogs

                    From this selection I formed 2 main lists:

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    One with items you can buy

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    The other is the list of useful apps

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    For the links I decided to try using QR codes as the catalogue will be printed out and to scan the code and go online is the easiest way for a viewer to reach your item

                    I was working with a lecture by Sheila Levrant De Bretteville at Walkers Art centre about her career and her projects
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    Specifically with a 3 minute part of her conference where she mostly talks about her one of the most recognisable feminist sign – eye bolt
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I picked this part of her speech as she talks passionately about this particular project and because of that has some high voice parts and quite a lot of slips of the tongue
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I analysed her speech from the sound, trying to notice her speech features
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    She does have an American accent, but it doesn’t affect her talking a lot
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Occasionally her voice level does change and noticeably her voice emphases just a part of the word
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Typographically I illustrated that with capital letters making the rest of the text low case letter
                </div>


                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Secondly,
                </div>


                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Her other speech feature is her tongue slips
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble27">
                    So she says a word or a couple of them and then corrects herself telling the right phrase
                    <img src="assets/Asset 16.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I showed it by at first writing the correct sentence with the same paragraph style as the rest of the text and then fitting her blooper and the correct phrase in the gap the size of the right words by decreasing letter spacing
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Talking about the type choice 
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    After the research on feminist fonts, I found that many feminist artists in their artworks used Futura typeface
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So I decided to stay with it as it’s sans-serif which reflects Sheila’s design as well
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    For the paper
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I made in-depth research on Sheila’s artworks and found out that she had nickname ‘Pinky’ because her recent very successful project was about the pink colour
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    Moreover, the pink colour stands for feminism and fits De Bretteville perfectly as she is an influential feminist activist. So my choice was uncoated 120 gsm pink paper
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I worked with ‘I only want you to love me’ photograph by Miles Aldridge
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    The pattern on the floor in that photograph was a perfect reference for a game–checkers
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I started going more in-depth in this game and realised that there are always two opposers
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So one can play with checkers that describe Aldridge’s work
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble31">
                    And the opposer will have antonyms
                    <img src="assets/Asset 6.png" alt="">
                </div>


                <div class="speech-bubble2">
                    I chose foam board for the background as I wanted to keep the vivid colour of the pattern and the best way to achieve that was the printer and right file preparation
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Talking about checkers, I worked with plywood and laser-cut and then coloured them
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I wanted checkers to be 3d and look like objects you can play with
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    And I colored checkers with spray paint as it gives most vibrant and smooth coverage
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    And foam will have a thickness so won’t look childish and very handmade
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    I decided to make a script for the game
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    Which will help me to control what’s in the shot
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">
                    So I chose two pairs of checkers: vibrant colour–pale colour, movement–stillness as I find it most relevant to Miles Aldridge
                </div>

                <div class="speech-bubble3">

                    I decided to choose red for the background to complete the vivid colour palette of Aldridge’s photo
